# GoPractice

Currently learning golang and I wanted a repo where I could mess around(and since everybody uses the github.com package naming)

This repository contains random golang code that I personally use to practice the language.

## Dependencies
You may need these as I use them in here:

```
go get github.com/spf13/viper
```

## Websites I used/can remember
